Diabetes Prediction Model

A machine learning project for predicting diabetes using a Random Forest model. The project leverages a diabetes dataset to train and evaluate the model, and a Flask-based web application is built to provide an interactive interface for users to input data and receive predictions.

Key Features
- Random Forest Model: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for accurate diabetes prediction.
- Diabetes Dataset: Trained on a comprehensive dataset containing relevant features for diabetes risk assessment.
- Flask Web Application: A user-friendly web interface for interacting with the model, enabling real-time predictions.

This project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning in healthcare through a robust prediction model and an accessible web-based interface.
